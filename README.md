# MinesweeperPlugin_UnrealEngine
A remake of the classic Minesweeper game, implemented as an Unreal Engine 4.27 Editor Plugin.

## How to install

Download *MinesweeperPlugin* directory and copy it on your Unreal project *Plugins* directory. Then open the project, go to **Editor->Plugins**, search for **Minesweeper Plugin** and toggle *Enable* on. Now just restart your project and enjoy.

## Description

After installation you'll find the **Minesweeper Plugin** button inside the Editor Main Toolbar. Click on the button to open *Minesweeper UI*, then you can drag it wherever you want inside the Editor (or outside).


## Level Editor

Inside the *Settings Tab* there's everythin you need to create your customized **Minesweeper Level**. Fill **Rows** and **Columns** text blocks to choose the size of the creating level, then select the number of **Mines** to put in. When you're ready click on *Generate Level* button to start playing.

## How to play

Try to unveil all Minesweeper Level safe cells without crashing on a Mine. Clicking on an empty cell will uncover all other safe cells on its surrounding. Also, if you click on a Mine-close empty cell, it will show you a suggestion on how many Mine cells you could find on its surroundings! Use logic and a bit of fortune to get through all the Mines and catch glory.

> You can find a resume of the rules on the bottom of the settings tab.
