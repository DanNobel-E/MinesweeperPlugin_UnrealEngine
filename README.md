## How to play

Try to unveil all Minesweeper Level safe cells without crashing on a Mine. Clicking on an empty cell will uncover all other safe cells on its surrounding. Also, if you click on a Mine-close empty cell, it will show you a suggestion on how many Mine cells you could find on its surroundings! Use logic and a bit of fortune to get through all the Mines and catch glory.
